# Dummy Touchpad Input Module
![image](DummyTouchpad.jpg)

This is a dummy touchpad.  All it does is contain the resistors and pads to
tell the FW16 that there is a touchpad installed (though there is not).
It also brings the signal lines out to a 2.54mm SMT header, but that's
mostly for debugging/development, not for any real use.

Here's the [schematic](./MinimalSmallInputModule.pdf).
